    Step 1

First, we need to create a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) password file.  To do this, open up Terminal and enter in the following command:

1
sudo mate /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
You will be required to enter your root password to edit the file. Enter in the following information, replacing <username@domain.com> with your google apps username and domain or your gmail account, and <password> with your password:



Save and exit.

Step 2

Next, we need to create a postfix lookup for our new SASL password file.  To do this, type the following command in the Terminal:

1
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
Step 3

Then we need to configure Postfix’s main.cf file which has all the configuration information for Postfix.  I would recommend backing up this file in case anything happens.  The first line of the following commands does just that, by creating a copy before editing it:

1
2
sudo cp /etc/postfix/main.cf /etc/postfix/main.cf.orig
sudo mate /etc/postfix/main.cf
Most of the information here is commented out.  You just need to scroll down to the bottom and paste in the following lines:


# Minimum Postfix-specific configurations.
mydomain_fallback = localhost
mail_owner = _postfix
setgid_group = _postdrop
relayhost=smtp.gmail.com:587

# Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP client.
smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options=

# Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS), i.e. SSL.
smtp_use_tls=yes
smtp_tls_security_level=encrypt
tls_random_source=dev:/dev/urandom
Save and exit.

Step 4

At this point, we just need to start up Postfix with our changes.  Use the following command:

1
sudo postfix start
If you entered in any information incorrectly in the main.cf file, this may throw errors.  Fix the errors and then reload Postfix:

1
sudo postfix reload
Step 5

You can test this configuration by sending a test email from Terminal:

1
date | mail -s test youremailaddress@yourdomain.com
If all goes well, you should receive an email to your inbox.

Step 6

Once you have everything working, you can set Postfix to start on boot by adding a key to /System/Library/ LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist file.

The key to add is:


<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>
The updated file looks like this (text version below):




<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>org.postfix.master</string>
  <key>Program</key>
  <string>/usr/libexec/postfix/master</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>master</string>
    <string>-e</string>
    <string>60</string>
  </array>
  <key>QueueDirectories</key>
  <array>
    <string>/var/spool/postfix/maildrop</string>
  </array>
  <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>
  <true/>
  <key>OnDemand</key>
  <true/>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
And that’s it! You should now be able to send mail using Mac OS X and Postfix from a PHP install. I am not an expert at this by any means, but feel free to leave a comment below letting me know if this helped you or if you have any issues with it. I would be glad to help in any way I can!
