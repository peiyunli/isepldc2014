step 1 : Get gps coord from an adress using Gmaps API
step 2 : Parse all the velib stations based on a xml file (carto.xml) and get the lats/longs coordinates in 2 arrays
step 3 : determine the distance on between the adresse and the station each station based on a php "webservice" made by us
step 4 : if the distance is smaller than the smallest that we had, then we get the index of this station + the current shorstest distant
step 5 : we print the result and email the user with the informations

======

HOW IT WORKS ?

* Just enter the postal adress you want : for example "4 rue isabey 75016"
* Then enter your email adress to have the result by mail

*** BE CAREFUL : The process is very slow (~8 minutes) because we ask a webservice to get the distance for each station. (there are 2451 stations).
